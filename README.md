# Arduino Based Light Sensor Control of Camera

I.	OBJECTIVES

- To conduct a flexible presentation in the classroom.
- To capture the entire presentation in an efficient manner. 
- To let teachers and students in different location participate in the set-up of a class without boundary. 
- To help the presenter focus more on his/her delivery of the message instead of the media to be used. 
- To utilize smart space technology inside the classroom and minimize the use of too much operation in terms of technicality. 

II.	SUMMARY

The Arduino-Based Light Sensor Control of Camera is consisting of Arduino Board, Breadboard, Jumper Wires, Servo Motor, Light Dependent Resistor, Cal switch, and Resistor (10K) as its materials. The proponents come up with a phase design in the concept of the Solar tracker prototype. Through the use of cardboard, paint, recycled materials, and Styrofoam, the proponents were able to create an output design. 

In the process of the prototype, the proponents programmed first the codes through writing it in the Arduino. They carry on the plan of programming the Arduino and after a lot of trials and hard work, the proponents were able to finish the codes and run it as an output. For the trials and testing they observe the product and were able to run it. Then assemble the storage of the prototype then figure out the concept behind the product. The proponents were able to conceive a light sensor control of camera to save time in class since the need statement of the group states that “We want to save time in class.”
